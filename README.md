Welcome to our virtual study buddy finder!

To use this application successfully, there are a couple basic steps to follow to make the most out of your experience.

1. Create an account by logging in with your google account. If you already have used this account with our application, it will recognize this and sign you in.

2. Update your profile! You can do this by either clicking the "View Profile" button on the homepage or clicking on "Profile" at the navigation bar at the top of the page. Clicking on "Edit Info" will allow you to update your info so that other people using the application can view your bio and invite you to their groups.

3. Add Courses! Once again, you can do this by either clicking the "View Profile" button on the homepage or clicking on "Courses" at the navigation bar at the top of the page. Scrolling down and clicking on "Edit Courses" will allow you to manage the courses in your schedule and add new courses. This is an important prerequisite to creating and joining study groups associated with those courses.

4. Create and Join Study Groups! Once you have courses added to your schedule and your preferences set, you can then create study groups by clicking on the course name under the "Profile" tab. This will show you all students taking that course, the available study groups that you can join, and an option to create a study group. You can also click on the "Groups" tab to create a study group. Once you are in one or more groups, you can view more information about that group by going to the "Groups" tab and clicking on one of your study groups. It will show information about each member in the group, as well as potential members that can be invited to the group.


How Notifications Work: When you request to join a study group, the owner of that study group will receive a notification of your request. If they accept the request, you will then be added to that study group and it will be shown under your "Groups" tab. If you are invited to a study group by a member of that group, you will receive a notification of the invite, and can either accept or simply ignore it by marking it as read. If accepted, you will immediately join that group. All notifications that you have received will be displayed on the home page. 

More Info: If you are the owner of the group, you can remove members of the group without having to notify them. In addition, you can only create groups for classes that you have added. If there are no available members for one of your groups, that means that no other students are taking that course. You can also leave groups that you are in by clicking on the "Groups" tab and clicking on "Leave Group" for the particular group you want to leave.
